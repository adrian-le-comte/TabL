# TabL
The sample is ready to use.

When I created my own IDE I struggled a lot in order to duplicate tabs with the WPF framework. I eventually found a solution that uses XmlWriters and XmlReaders.

TabL is an example of code in order to duplicate Tabs in a WPF application.

# Instructions
You can copy paste the code, you will be able to add or remove tabs with the implemented shortcuts, Ctrl + T to add and Ctrl + W to delete.
The useful thing in this sample is that I implemented a dictionary system where the key is the ID of the tab, therefore each tab is differenciable.
You can associate data to tabs, it was useful for one of my other projects, you can for example store an object and then access it and modify it easily.
I have developped an IDE so it was very useful to keep information about each tab, for example if you need, you can use it to save the text from the current tab.
