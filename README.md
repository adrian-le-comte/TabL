# TabL
The code is not finished yet.

When I created idL I struggled a lot in order to duplicate tabs for the IDE (idL). I eventually found a solution that uses XmlwWriters and XmlReaders. In order to avoid some other people this struggling I will try to develop this code as much as possible to make it easy to duplicate tabs in a WPF application.

TabL is an example of code in order to duplicate Tabs in a wpf application. The name of the tabcontrol and the duplicated tab is needed in order to do that.
